      <description>I have been experiencing an issue, after a software update. An example of this software is that videos are playing however, there are pink lights flickering.&#xA;ive tried updating my system, tried using different applications, modifying the backend of the system. This issue is persistant.&#xA;The result is that i had to erase my operating system and reinstalled it. Nothing has gone wrong so far.</description>

Especially in topics like security.&#xA;The module im currently working on is linux. I am currently using linux on a daily basis, so it would be good to get a better understanding.&#xA;I have lost my progress for my sql server since ive been playing around with the opensuse operating system and trying to configure a windows manager.</description>

      <description>I have been advised to learn more about digital security. So someone recommended hack the box - https://www.hackthebox.com.&#xA;This gives any users a better an understanding of what happens being the person targeted and the person hacking.&#xA;The understanding from a linux point of view is nice also since linux is becoming more and more of the norm in my daily life.</description>

      <description>I have been created the database and inserted the data into the table. However the trouble that i have encountered is the foreign key. Several conditions have to met before the foreign key can be created.&#xA;The foreign key must not be null: (This means the value cannot be null) The table that contains the foreign key must have data for the primary key to be set. The foreign key needs to link to a primary key in a different table.</description>

      <description>I have created a idea of how the database is going to look for learning purposes. However, to get a better practice im trying to draw up a database design and then. Link them through primary keys according to my design and adjust it if i find any errors with the code. I have attempted to draw a design through a website: https://dbdiagram.io&#xA;However, it has caused my laptop to crash.</description>

I was able to create a database and table. I managed to call out the data, was not expecting this kind of result though.</description>

      <description>Finally, Broke through and understood what ive been doing wrong this whole time. Github responds very differently especially when using hugo. - Lesson to away from here is READ DOCUMENTATION PROPERLY.&#xA;I finally Decided on a theme (Paper) - https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/.&#xA;It was quite easy understanding that the hugo.toml file controls the majority of features in the website. Its much easier than an HTML to understand - However having that background knowledge did give me an advantage.</description>

      <description>After pushing into github again with a new post that was created by the hugo the changes were not made. I tested this by awaiting for 10 minutes and clearing cache. The issue changes were still not made. I did some research. How hugo shows the changes is through the content in the public folder. I tried to make those changes manually however the page would give me a error along of the lines cannot see the content</description>

So on linux there are two software that i can use Gimp and Inkscape. Gimp was already installed on the system. So i installed the software with the below command.&#xA;flatpak install flathub org.inkscape.Inkscape&#xA;I was playing around with the software to see if i could manage to create the picture myself.</description>

      <description>I was having trouble with getting a profile picture working because im still new to the hugo Software. I attempted to implement my previous knowledge of web development and leave the the png file in my main repository. However, that did not resolve the issue because the image couldnt be seen by the system. I did do some quick troubleshooting by using a solid color and naming profile.png. Then going to developers tools, under any settings, right clicking on the profile picture and &amp;ldquo;inspecting element&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I was able to get a better understanding of React js in general and able to make some progress with the webpage development through the use of the footer. Accomplished: The footer was simple enough to be created however there was spacing issues on the webpage because i was not used to the default style sheet. It would be very difficult to locate the specific style and which px or element was creating the space.</description>

      <description>I was write about the assumption from yesterday. By following out of date information and using an out of date react js library i wont be able to draw out the whole potential of React js.&#xA;Accomplished: I follow the instructions in the website above however could not get the pages to work the way the website was expecting me to get it. I was able to create the physical pages and get the link by manually putting the URL through the search bar of the browser but could not get the navigation bar or element to show up as a pressable link.</description>

      <description>Today, I have made too many changes to react. I was hoping to make a website through some youtube videos. However, the functions being used maybe out of date as these videos are 4 years old now. Accomplished: When running npm start, the terminal suggested to use &amp;ldquo;npm audit fix &amp;ndash;force&amp;rdquo; to resolve any conflicts on any pages. I attempted to run this several times. The terminal said there were a few functions that having conflicts.</description>
