I have been experiencing an issue, after a software update.
An example of this software is that videos are playing however, 
there are pink lights flickering. 

ive tried updating my system, tried using different applications,
modifying the backend of the system. This issue is persistant. 

The result is that i had to erase my operating system and reinstalled it. 
Nothing has gone wrong so far.
