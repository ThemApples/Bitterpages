I have been created the database and inserted the data into the table. 
However the trouble that i have encountered is the foreign key. Several conditions have to met before the foreign key can be created.

1. The foreign key must not be null: (This means the value cannot be null)

2. The table that contains the foreign key must have data for the primary key to be set.
![insert](insert.png)

3. The foreign key needs to link to a primary key in a different table. This was done the same way in the first screenshot but the table student.

Then the Foreign key is made:
