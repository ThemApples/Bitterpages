I Nearly gave up on the idea of hosting my own site.
I came across a youtube link that uses a different language to create the webpage.
The language is Hugo

Accomplished:
I was able to find a host create a website.
Choose a theme - ( https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/soho/ ) or (https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-m10c/)
host the website through github pages.

#Installing hugo
sudo zypper install hugo

#Creating the website
hugo new site bitterpages

#Getting a new theme
cd themes
git clone https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/soho/

Issue: -Nothing so far
Thoughts:
Will this teach me what i want?
(This will teach me to start from scratch to understand how the language works)
(This will also teach me how work with multiple software and how they integrate with each other)
