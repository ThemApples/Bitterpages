Im wanting to create a new profile picture from scratch.
Im hoping to create a profile picture that has minimalistic apperance.
So on linux there are two software that i can use Gimp and Inkscape.
Gimp was already installed on the system.
So i installed the software with the below command.

flatpak install flathub org.inkscape.Inkscape

I was playing around with the software to see if i could manage to create the picture myself.
Nope, I couldnt really work this out.
I went to search the web for some kind of tutorial and found this:

With this i created the profile picture in 20 minutes.
Once finished i compressed the image to PNG format and ran the command below to test it. - it worked.

Hugo Server
I pushed the resulting website through to github and waited for the script to read the changes. to see if it worked.
However, no it did not show up.

I troubleshooted to see if i could see the image and also used the developers tools to see i could see its pointing to the correct profile picture but i couldnt see it.

Issue:
- The profile picture is not working after deploying to github
