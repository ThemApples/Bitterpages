I was able to get an understanding of React js in general and able to make some progress with the webpage development.
Accomplished:
I need a general understanding of how the react Router worked so i went online to do some research - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi32YwjoN2U
The youtube video help me get a better understanding of the router.
I implemented those lessons into my method and it started working. Now i had made a home page and so it.
I was able to rebuild a a new project and compare the front page was and found app method is being Referred incorrect and thats why my front page didnt work.

Issue:
- Front page was showing blank.

Thoughts:
Is the Reactjs pages being seen by each method?
How does Reactjs work with each page. How does it know its in the right place?
