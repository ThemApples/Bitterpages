Im not too familiar to how to get mysql working so i followed the guide below.

I did encounter some errors as apart of this.

I did end up resolving this issue because the software couldnt make an connection with something the wasnt named as.

I finally was able to have a play around, i havent touched this since university.
I was able to create a database and table.

I managed to call out the data, was not expecting this kind of result though. I can see a logical error in what ive created so i may need to prevent this when i create my database.

The next step will be drawing up a database design.
