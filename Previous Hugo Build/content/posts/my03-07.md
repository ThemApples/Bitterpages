I have created a idea of how the database is going to look for learning purposes. 
However, to get a better practice im trying to draw up a database design and then. 
Link them through primary keys according to my design and adjust it if i find any errors with the code. 
I have attempted to draw a design through a website:
https://dbdiagram.io

However, it has caused my laptop to crash. 
When i restarted the computer, the browser would lag to a point that i wont be able to touch anything within the browser. 

I tried the webpage with a different browser it is possible to create a chart without it crashing. 
The browser i was working on had a alot of security implementation set on. 
I installed chrome and not issue while trying to create the database:
