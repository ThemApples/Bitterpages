The website is now ready to be deployed
There is still alot that needs to be changed however will have to do
I have been able to get most of the primary functionality working.
I have gotten a hugo website in the test environment however its acting the same way.
im still researching on if i should manually create a hugo website or if its even possible

The next update may take some time because im trying to start learning SQL are apart of my career path.
The challenging thing is that i will have deploy windows through a VM because the developers kit for SQL works on windows

There are a few other small languages and programs im going to learn because i need expand my horizon.
