I was able to get a better understanding of React js in general and able to make some progress with the webpage development through the use of the navbar.
Accomplished:
I included the "export default Layout;" in my Layout because i tried at looking at everything else but nothing worked. (Adding that small amount of code worked.)
React didnt know what it was trying to render therefore showing up a white page. I cleaned my code also, in my next update need to add the projects into pages and also a Messy page at the beginning
Issue:
- Navbar
Thoughts:
Why is my navbar not showing up and why did the navbar not need export option at the end of the code Everytime I implement the Navbar its doesnt connect to any pages it only shows up with a white page with nothing on it.
