I finally found solution is for images being displayed in the hugo website:
https://parzival2.github.io/blog/posts/add-images-hugo/

From what i can understanding the hugo website using the static folder to display content.
So by create a image directory and the post name the image will be shown. 
I have tried to go through any previous entries and updated them with images.
