I was write about the assumption from yesterday. By following out of date information and using an out of date react js library i wont be able to draw out the whole potential of React js.

Accomplished:
I follow the instructions in the website above however could not get the pages to work the way the website was expecting me to get it. I was able to create the physical pages and get the link by manually putting the URL through the search bar of the browser but could not get the navigation bar or element to show up as a pressable link.

Issue: - Pages links not working.
Thoughts:
My own understand of react was from a few years ago because technology is constantly growing. Is my train of thought correct?
I went only did some more research and found this to connect pages - https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial
So i continuted to try searching various websites for an understanding of how react js worked.
