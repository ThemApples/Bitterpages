I have been advised to learn more about digital security. So someone recommended hack the box - https://www.hackthebox.com. 

This gives any users a better an understanding of what happens being the person targeted and the person hacking. 

The understanding from a linux point of view is nice also since linux is becoming more and more of the norm in my daily life.
