I have completed my first module on the hack in the box website.
URL: https://www.hackthebox.com/

I have started to learn a different way of understanding how to study. Especially in topics like security.

The module im currently working on is linux. I am currently using linux on a daily basis, so it would be good to get a better understanding.

I have lost my progress for my sql server since ive been playing around with the opensuse operating system and trying to configure a windows manager.
