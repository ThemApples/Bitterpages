I have created a idea of how the database is going to look for learning purposes. 
However, to get a better practice im trying to draw up a database design and then. 
Link them through primary keys according to my design and adjust it if i find any errors with the code. 
I have attempted to draw a design through a website:
https://dbdiagram.io

However, it has caused my laptop to crash. 
When i restarted the computer, the browser would lag to a point that i wont be able to touch anything within the browser. 

I may need to run through lucid chart.
