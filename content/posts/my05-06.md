After pushing into github again with a new post that was created by the hugo
the changes were not made. I tested this by awaiting for 10 minutes and clearing cache.
The issue changes were still not made.
I did some research. How hugo shows the changes is through the content in the public folder.
I tried to make those changes manually however the page would give me a error along of the lines cannot see the content

Im not too sure if its specific to this theme.
As a temporary soultion i have started using a Free Bootstrap soultion until i get a better understanding of hugo:
https://themes.getbootstrap.com/

I have to change my approach between developing this type of website.
I will have to create a deployment environment and A tester environment (For what git will accept)

As off now the Bootstrap base is still currently in the tester environment Im still playing around with the paragraphs and icons to get it working on with my profile picture

Issue:
- The profile picture is not working after deploying to github - posts not showing after deploying to github
