This is the beginning of my journey developing a website to documenting all upskilling.
Accomplished:
- Reactjs create through node js (Code command - "npx create-react-app my-app")
- no issue running the react js website (Ran the website using "npm start" From my_apps directory)

npx create-react-app my-app

Issue: Trying to implement the use of muliple pages for react to view mulitple projects.
An error message saying "react js export 'AbortedDeferredError'"
Thoughts:
I thought i didnt have the correct version of Node js or React or plugin installed.
Attempted to get the most latest node through using the command (npm install -g npm@latest)
The update was successful however the issue still kept appearing.
