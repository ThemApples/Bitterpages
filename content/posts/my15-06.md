Finally, Broke through and understood what ive been doing wrong this whole time. 
Github responds very differently especially when using hugo. - Lesson to away from here is READ DOCUMENTATION PROPERLY.

I finally Decided on a theme (Paper) - https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/. 

It was quite easy understanding that the hugo.toml file controls the majority of features in the website.
Its much easier than an HTML to understand - However having that background knowledge did give me an advantage.
What i didnt understand is what the comments feature was, posting on github on the test server was showing up even though there was no plug up on the toml.
Feature below.

Until i read more into the themes toml file.
I had to remove everything related to GISCUS. I had to remove a majority of the code below.

The other problem is that the profile picture was still showing up as blank. I couldnt work out what the reference word gravatar was. Until i thought again, it was referencing to put in an email or url, so i searched it up and found its an online software. 
However, when i put in the email or the URL nothing was showing. However, i thought about it how would the website or program understand out of the whole page where the picture was then it hit me. I had to right click and get the URL for an image in general.
