I am preparing the operating system so that i can get some understanding how Oracle.
I dont know which environment i will be trying it on windows 11 or windows 10. I might begin with windows 10 because there are more bug fixes and then transition onto windows 11. 

Since im on linux im following to install Virtual box.
https://en.opensuse.org/VirtualBox

I am using Opensuse and encountering an issue when trying to use this virtual box.

I will need to find an alternative at this stage. 
I have done a quick search for in on the flathub but cannot find it. 
I might need to install wine to locally use the tools to learn oracle.
