I was able to get a better understanding of React js in general and able to make some progress with the webpage development through the use of the footer.
Accomplished:
The footer was simple enough to be created however there was spacing issues on the webpage because i was not used to the default style sheet. It would be very difficult to locate the specific style and which px or element was creating the space. I know a way of more accurately pin pointing the variable. The developer tool built into the web browser has a "Inspect element" feature, this color codes each element and by changing the element in the developer mode it gives a temporary change so i could play around with any modifications.
Also added the hosting features: (Deploying the website on github)
