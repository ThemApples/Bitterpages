Today i was able to find a way to generate a website through react but with a different script.
Accomplished:
I was able to generate a website with the same feature with the gh pages script.
Issue:
- still not hosting through github.

Thoughts:
With so many version of react and my lack of understanding of the gh pages feature on github will it work.
