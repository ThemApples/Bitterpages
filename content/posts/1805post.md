Today i was able to find a way to generate a website through react but with a different script.

Accomplished:
I was able to generate a website with the same feature with the gh pages script.

```
Issue:
 - still not hosting through github.
```

Thoughts:
With so many version of react and my lack of understanding of the gh pages feature on github will it work.
