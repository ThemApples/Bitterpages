Im wanting to create a new profile picture from scratch. 
Im hoping to create a profile picture that has minimalistic apperance. 
So on linux there are two software that i can use Gimp and Inkscape.

Gimp was already installed on the system.
So i installed the software with the below command.

```go {linenos=inline}
flatpak install flathub org.inkscape.Inkscape
```

I was playing around with the software to see if i could manage to create the picture myself. 
Nope, I couldnt really work this out.
I went to search the web for some kind of tutorial and found this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-HamFrltj4

With this i created the profile picture in 20 minutes. 
Once finished i compressed the image to PNG format and ran the command below to test it. - it worked.

```go {linenos=inline}
Hugo Server
```

I pushed the resulting website through to github and waited for the script to read the changes. 
to see if it worked. 
However, no it did not show up. 

I troubleshooted to see if i could see the image and also used the developers tools to see i could see its pointing to the correct profile picture but i couldnt see it. 


Issue:
- The profile picture is not working after deploying to github
