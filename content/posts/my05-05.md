Today, I have made too many changes to react. I was hoping to make a website through some youtube videos. However, the functions being used maybe out of date as these videos are 4 years old now.
Accomplished:
When running npm start, the terminal suggested to use "npm audit fix --force" to resolve any conflicts on any pages. I attempted to run this several times. The terminal said there were a few functions that having conflicts.I search google for any soultion to fix these when fixing these conflicts. The webpage was referring to links in the code i couldnt find. So i Decided to start from scratch.

AbortedDeferredError

Issue: AbortedDeferredError - this issue still happening.

Thoughts: Is there anything that can be done with the terminal?
can i run anything to fix any connections for methods or functions. (found npm audit fix --force)
A fresh start?
